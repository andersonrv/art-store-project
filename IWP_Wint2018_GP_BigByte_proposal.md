The Project:

The team is to develop an application to ease the operation of a catering business.
Specifically, it will capture orders from a predefined list of meals, create a
shopping list to meet the orders placed, and collect payment of the order. 

Initial Summary of Features:

House a list of ingredients per meal, maintenance of orders placed, 
provide for a delivery schedule, provide confirmation of order placed to the client.

Desirable Features:

Maintenance of a Client Master List (with address, credit card
info, contact information) for repeated orders processing;

Maintenance of an Ingredient Master List with prices (for costing purposes);

Maintenance of an Orders Master List with prices and costs (for profitability
control).

Queries by the Administrator (Backend):

1. Bill of Materials: The query is to access the orders database and the ingredients
database for a predefined period of time. It will result in a list of ingredients
necessary to purchase to complete the orders for that period.

2. Delivery Schedule: The query is to access the orders database and the clients database
for the period of time defined. It will print out the meals to deliver, the client
name and the address.

3. Database update: Administrators are to be able to add, delete or modify any of the
databases.

4. Order confirmation: The administrator is to review the weekly orders and email
clients confirming the processing of their order.

Info to the Clients (Frontend):

1. Meals: A description of the meals and a rough list of ingredients that are
to have pictures and which can be selected for orders.

2. Client Information: Clients are to register names, address and payment information.

3. Orders: The client is to be able to place new orders and pick a delivery date from
options the app is to provide. The orders can be assembled from scratch, or from old
orders (repeating items previously ordered).


The project would be divided as follows:

1. Webpage design - Bootstrap, HTML, CSS and javascript coding.
2. Server side programming
3. Database creation and maintenance features

All team members will need to work on all aspects of the project.
